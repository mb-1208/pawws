Why use a dog's head? Because dogs are one of the unique, cool, <br /> and many types of characters so it will be very fun to explore. <br /><br />

And dog itself contains uniqueness in the common language in Indonesia as a word to express both<br /> positive and negative expressions of cool "dog" and so on. <br /><br />

With Pawws as this canvas, "SINGPENTINKHAPPY" explores the wide variety of psychedelic shapes and <br /> colors that are his trademark in his work. <br /> <br />

The forms are free and non-standard, not bound by the rules of composition, but flow naturally without <br /> sketches, these are all inspired by the frequent lucid dreams that flow and move around the dimensions <br /> of space and time, but still in the conscious state that it is dreaming at the moment.<br /><br /> 

Therefore, the dream is visible & remembered very clearly because "SINGPENTINKHAPPY" is the subject<br /> of the observer, so it can record and re-pour on the blank canvas of Pawws. Draw it back without<br /> planning or concept & flowing without sketching. */}
Pawws is a blank canvas in the shape of a dog's head, which is deliberately chosen as a medium to <br/> pour freedom of expression for anyone regardless of who they are or what ideologies they have. <br/> Why use a dog's head? Because a dog is a man’s best friend. The word ‘dog’ itself is unique in the <br/> Indonesian language, because it is a word to express both positive and negative expressions.<br /><br /> 

With Pawws as his canvas, “singpentinkhappy” explores his trademark art style - psychedelic art.<br /><br /> 

The characters in Pawws are free, non-standard, not bound by the rules of composition, and flow <br/> naturally without sketches. These are all inspired by “singpentinkhappy’s” lucid dreams that flow <br/> and move around the dimensions of space and time, but still in the conscious state that it is <br/> dreaming at the moment.<br /><br /> 

Therefore, the dream is visible & remembered very clearly because “singpentinkhappy” is the <br/> subject of the observer, so it can re-express itself on the blank canvas of Pawws.<br /><br />
